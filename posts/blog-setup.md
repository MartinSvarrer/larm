# Writing experience

I want my blog to be version controlled and saved in plain text. Markdown is a familiar format for me, and comes with all the features I think I need for writing my articles about development. Should I need more features I should be able to migrate from markdown to something else pretty easy, using something like [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

GitHub-flavored markdown is to me the easiest choice, as I will be hosting my source code for the blog on GitHub and general tooling support for Github-flavored Markdown is relatively easy to find.

Next up I need to use an editor. My only requirement for now is spell-checking, and a minimal of visualization to know my markdown is correctly formatted. For this need Visual Studio Code with [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright) extension seems to do the trick.
