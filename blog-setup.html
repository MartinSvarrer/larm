<h1>Hello world</h1>
<p>As this is a tech blog, a hello world post seems appropriate. What better way to start than describing my approach to building my blog from scratch. I decided to not use an existing platform just for the fun of being able to learn some new things while building the blog itself.</p>
<h1>Writing experience</h1>
<p>I want my blog to be version controlled and saved in plain text. Markdown is a familiar format for me, and comes with all the features I think I need for writing my articles about development. Should I need more features I should be able to migrate from markdown to something else pretty easy, using something like <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>.</p>
<p>CommonMark markdown is to me the easiest choice, as it seems to be a common supported flavor by VS Code, Pandoc, and Github.</p>
<p>Next up I need to use an editor. My only requirement for now is spell-checking, and a minimal of visualization to know my markdown is correctly formatted. For this need Visual Studio Code with <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright">Spell Right</a> extension seems to do the trick.</p>
<h1>Compile markdown to HTML</h1>
<p>For building a blog I will need to create a website with some static pages and somehow compile each blog post into a page which fits the overall design of the website. Each markdown file should be compiled to unique HTML pages.</p>
<p>VS code comes with a build-in preview mode. VS Code uses <a href="https://markdown-it.github.io/">markdown-it</a>, and I have decided to jump on board an use the same for automating the generation of my static web pages.</p>
