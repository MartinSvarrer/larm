      <h1>A beginners guide to Magic the Gathering</h1>
      <p>
        This is not as much a guide for beginners, as it's me, a beginner,
        attempting to make small guides for other beginners.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a guide to learn the game, but more about all the scary,
        confusing things.

      <h2>Buying cards</h2>
      <p>Get a <cite>starter kit</cite>.</p>
      <p>
        A starter kit is basically all you need to play. Like buying a board
        game.
      </p>
      <p>Each starter kit comes with 2 decks.</p>
      <p>
        Don't worry about getting the newest kit or if the starter kit comes
        with a special theme, like Lord of the Rings.
      </p>
      <h2>Buying more cards (booster packs)</h2>
      <p>
        When you buy Magic the gathering cards, they come in "booster packs".
      </p>
      <p>Booster pack just means a bunch of random cards.</p>
      <p>
        There is different types of boosters available: <cite>Draft</cite>,
        <cite>set</cite>, <cite>jumpstart</cite> and
        <cite>collector</cite> boosters (there is probably more, that I don't
        know about).
      </p>
      <h3>Draft boosters</h3>
      <p>
        Draft boosters are the <em>original</em> type of boosters, and works
        well for playing the draft and sealed game formats (game formats is
        different ways you can play the game).
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't actually tried to play draft format myself yet. But I did buy
        some draft boosters, just to own some cards, that wasn't part of a deck
        (didn't want to split my starter deck).
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I had the most fun with buying some
        <cite>Dominaria Remastered</cite> draft boosters because they have some
        old cards reprinted in their original design, which to me looks super
        cool.
      </p>
      <h3>Set boosters</h3>
      <p>
        I also bought some set boosters to own even more cards. Unlike draft
        boosters, they don't have a special purpose other than just opening
        packs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now I prefer to buy set boosters, if I just want to open some
        packs of cards.
      </p>
      <h3>Jumpstart boosters</h3>
      <p>Jumpstart boosters are pre-made decks around a single theme.</p>
      <p>
        You need two packs per player. You likely want to keep these cards
        together to play with them again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ended up buying some
        <a
          href="https://www.dragonshield.com/webshop/us/deck-boxes/651-cube-shell-shadow-black.html"
          >Dragon Shield cube shell's</a
        >
        to store my jumpstart decks in (fits 20 cards perfectly).
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever I want to play jumpstart I take four random boxes, shuffle two
        together for each player, and we play.
      </p>
      <p>
        I often play with the same combo a few times, to get an understanding of
        the cards in the deck better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have found that you don't often see the same cards game to game, in
        this format.
      </p>
      <p>I didn't try to buy any collector boosters yet.</p>

      <h2>Game formats</h2>
      <p>
        I played with the starter decks. Great fun. Don't know what format they
        are. Doesn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also played <strong>jumpstart</strong> a bunch. Its a great way to try
        and play some more cards, without having to build any decks.
